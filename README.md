# Sales Email Manager Agent

A powerful Python tool that leverages OpenAI agents and SendGrid to automate cold email outreach, enforce budget limits, and capture detailed usage analytics for recruiters and development teams.

> **Elevator pitch:** A robust AI-driven sales email manager that crafts, sends, and monitors outreach with built-in budget control and usage analytics.

---

## üîç Key Features Demonstrated

* **Modular Agent Framework**: Utilizes multiple GPT-4o-mini personas (Professional, Engaging, Busy) orchestrated by a manager agent to generate optimized email copy.
* **Intelligent Agent Orchestration**: The Sales Manager agent invokes each persona tool, compares their generated emails, and picks the single most suitable message to send out.
* **Automated Sending**: Integrated SendGrid function-tool handles email dispatch, complete with error handling and retry logic.
* **Budget Enforcement**: Reads per-email cost and cumulative spend, automatically skipping sends when a GBP budget cap is reached.
* **Usage Logging**: Logs core ML usage metrics‚Äîprompt tokens, completion tokens, total tokens, and cost in GBP‚Äîinto a CSV (`usage_log.csv`) for auditing and forecasting.
* **Timezone-aware Timestamps**: Employs Python‚Äôs `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` to generate precise UTC ISO8601 timestamps.
* **Resilient Data Extraction**: Gracefully handles variations in the usage object structure, ensuring robust token and cost tracking across SDK changes.

## üìä Logs & Metrics

The CSV log (`usage_log.csv`) captures:

| Column              | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`         | ISO8601 UTC when the request completed   |
| `month`             | Year-month for easy grouping (`YYYY-MM`) |
| `model`             | Agent model name (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)   |
| `prompt_tokens`     | Number of prompt tokens consumed         |
| `completion_tokens` | Number of completion tokens returned     |
| `total_tokens`      | Sum of prompt + completion tokens        |
| `cost_gbp`          | Calculated cost in GBP                   |

Use these metrics for budgeting, forecasting, and performance reviews.
