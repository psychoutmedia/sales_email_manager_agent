# Sales Email Manager Agent

A powerful Python tool that leverages OpenAI agents, custom agent tools, and seamless handoff orchestration to automate cold email outreach, enforce budget limits, and capture detailed usage analytics for recruiters and development teams.

> **Elevator pitch:** A robust AI-driven sales email manager that crafts, sends, and monitors outreach with built-in budget control, usage analytics, and pluggable persona tools.

---

## üîç Key Features Demonstrated

* **Modular Agent Framework**: Utilizes multiple GPT-4o-mini personas (Professional, Engaging, Busy) orchestrated by a manager agent to generate optimized email copy.
* **Agent Tools Ecosystem**: Three specialized sales agent tools‚Äî`ColdEmailPersonaPro`, `ColdEmailPersonaEngage`, and `ColdEmailPersonaBusy`‚Äîeach optimized for different tones and buyer profiles.
* **Intelligent Tool Orchestration & Handoffs**: The Sales Manager agent automatically invokes each persona tool in sequence, evaluates their outputs, and selects the best-performing email. Once chosen, it hands off to the **Email Manager** agent for formatting, dispatch, and delivery tracking.
* **Automated Sending**: Integrated SendGrid function-tool handles email dispatch, complete with error handling, retry logic, and delivery status callbacks.
* **Budget Enforcement**: Monitors per-email cost against a configurable GBP budget cap; suspends sending when the limit is reached.
* **Usage Logging & Analytics**: Logs core ML usage metrics‚Äîprompt tokens, completion tokens, total tokens, and cost in GBP‚Äîinto a CSV (`usage_log.csv`) for auditing, forecasting, and dashboarding.
* **Timezone-aware Timestamps**: Employs Python‚Äôs `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` to generate precise UTC ISO8601 timestamps, ensuring consistent logs across regions.
* **Resilient Data Extraction**: Adapts to any changes in the OpenAI SDK‚Äôs usage response format, guaranteeing accurate token and cost tracking even after API updates.

## üÜï What's New in This Release

* **Custom Agent Tools**: Three new pluggable agent tools (`ColdEmailPersonaPro`, `ColdEmailPersonaEngage`, `ColdEmailPersonaBusy`) that specialize in tone, style, and industry-specific messaging.
* **Handoff Architecture**: Seamless agent-to-agent handoffs‚ÄîSales Manager ‚Üí Email Manager‚Äîdecoupling email content generation from dispatch logic.
* **Enhanced Configuration**: New `.env` variables to customize agent selection logic, introduce new persona tools, and control handoff parameters.
* **Extensible Tool Registry**: Auto-discover and register any new agent tool by subclassing `YourToolBaseClass`‚Äîno manual updates needed in the main script.

Run the agent manager to craft and send a cold email:

```bash
python sales_email_manager_agent.py
```

* **Script**: `sales_email_manager_agent.py`
* **Output**: Final email content printed to console, sent via SendGrid, and usage metrics appended to `usage_log.csv`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Agent Tools & Handoffs

1. **Sales Manager Agent** (`sales_manager`)

   * Invokes each persona tool listed in `AGENT_TOOLS`, compares generated drafts, and picks the winner.
   * Hands off payload to **Email Manager Agent**.

2. **Email Manager Agent** (`email_manager`)

   * Formats the selected draft into HTML, populates recipient data, and calls the SendGrid tool.
   * Logs delivery status back to the manager.

3. **Persona Tools**

   * `ColdEmailPersonaPro`: Formal, consultative tone.
   * `ColdEmailPersonaEngage`: Conversational, benefit-led tone.
   * `ColdEmailPersonaBusy`: Short, to-the-point, high-level executive summary.

Adding a new persona tool is as simple as subclassing `YourToolBaseClass` and including it in the `AGENT_TOOLS` list.

## üìä Logs & Metrics

The CSV log (`usage_log.csv`) captures:

| Column              | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`         | ISO8601 UTC when the request completed   |
| `month`             | Year-month for easy grouping (`YYYY-MM`) |
| `model`             | Agent model name (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)   |
| `prompt_tokens`     | Number of prompt tokens consumed         |
| `completion_tokens` | Number of completion tokens returned     |
| `total_tokens`      | Sum of prompt + completion tokens        |
| `cost_gbp`          | Calculated cost in GBP                   |

Use these metrics for budgeting, forecasting, and performance reviews.
